Formy is a React form library with a very simple API where you put all your form logic in a class.

This is what it looks like:

```ts
import { Field } from "@formx/formy";

class PersonForm {
  firstName = Field(TextField);
  lastName = Field(TextField);
  fullName = Field(TextField);

  init = (context) => {
    this.firstName.value = context.person?.firstName ?? "";
    this.lastName.value = context.person?.lastName ?? "";
    this.fullName.value = context.person
      ? `${context.person.firstName} ${context.person.lastName}`
      : "";
    this.firstName.schema = yup.string().required();
  };

  update = (context, reason) => {
    this.firstName.props = {
      label: "First name",
    };
    this.lastName.props = {
      label: "Last name",
    };
    this.fullName.props = {
      label: "Full name",
      isDisabled: true,
    };
    this.calculateFullName(reason);
  };

  calculateFullName = (reason: UpdateReason) => {
    if (
      reason.type === "value" &&
      (reason.name === "firstName" || reason.name === "lastName")
    ) {
      this.fullName.value = `${this.firstName.value} ${this.lastName.value}`;
    }
  };
}
```

## Explanation

### Fields

We created our fields as class properties using the `field` function which accepts the component we wish to render for the field.
The component will receive a `field` prop to be able to connect it it with the form.

### Init

`init` is called on mount of the `Form` component and on reset. It receives the `Context` object for external dependencies.
In this case, it would be a Person object from the server.

### Update

`update` is called each time anything related to the form changes. This could be:

- value of a field
- error of a field
- context

In this method you can pass props to your components via `props` object, or you can use it as an effect and set a value to a calculated field as in the example.

It receives the `context` object and the `reason` prop. You can use `reason` to know exactly why the update was called, and you can act accordingly.
